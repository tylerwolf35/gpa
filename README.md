# FRHSD GPA Calculator
This site lets you calculate your GPA using the weighting found in the FRHSD student handbook.

I plan on making a browser extension that scrapes the parent portal and calculates your GPA, getting the grades as data from the html table has been tough, and this should be released once I get that figured out.
